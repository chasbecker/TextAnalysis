Python script to develop methods for handling text, word counts, and like that.

I am taking two approaches on this.  The first is 'function words' counting, and the second is text sentiment analysis using the Azure Text Analysis service (REST API).

Both approaches (function word and text sentiment) are working at a technical level, but I don't know what to make of the results.  Maybe there's nothing here.  It's giving me a chance to practise some cool, useful techniques.
